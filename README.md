# Photography For Me

## JPA Full Stack Midterm Project at Skill Distillery - December 2021

### Built By:
* [Andrew Shumway: Software Engineer / Scrum Master](https://github.com/A-Shumway42)
* [Chris Delong: Software Engineer / CSS King](https://github.com/FrostHavenGames)
* [Jordon Paynter: Software Engineer / Database Administrator](https://github.com/Panthro22)
* [Ben Allegrezza: Software Engineer / GitHub Repository Owner](https://github.com/Bengrezza)

### Project Requirements:
This was a week-long sprint using Agile Methodologies to exceed the minimum viable product for our midterm  [assignment](https://github.com/SkillDistillery/SD31/blob/master/midtermGroupProject/README.md).

### Application Mission:

PhotographyForMe will connect consumers with great local photographers. It will also give local photographers a platform to manage their business and trade resources. Along the way, PhotographyForMe will hope to enrich lives of consumers and photographers. In pursuit of this mission, PhotographyForMe wants to provide the most helpful information possible about photographers to consumers, and the most seamless business management platform for photographers.

### Overview:

This program is designed to be a full stack website application that creates, reads, updates and deletes user, photographer, image and contract data from a database we built using MySQL Workbench and connecting with using Java Database Connectivity.

### How to Run:

First, the user enters the home page. The user can choose to:
* Register as a user or photographer
* Login if already a user or photographer
* Search photographers logged-in or not logged-in
* View photographer reviews

A logged in user can:
* Update their profile
* Deactivate their profile
* Search for photographers

A logged in photographer can:
* Update their profile
* Add/Remove gallery/image
* Deactivate their profile
* View open/closed contracts
* View current/previous contracts


Demo Photographer Accout:
* Username: strider
* Password: ranger

### Technologies Used:

Java, Java Persistence API, Spring MVC & STS, Gradle, SQL, MySQL Workbench, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Apache, Tomcat, AWS, Atom, Git, GitHub, Google Docs and Presentations,  and Trello.

### Topics Implemented:

Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.

Tomcat 8 on AWS EC2 Instance.

JSP Standard Tag Library to generate HTML.

CCS and Bootstrap to make it web and mobile-friendly.

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

Relational Database: SQL Database creation using MySQL Workbench.

Java Libraries: SQL, List, and handling exceptions.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Test Driven Development using JUNIT Juniper.

### Database Schema Design:

### Lessons Learned:

This project helped us better grasp the capabilities of Dynamic Web Applications by allowing us to better learn how to:
* Build a multi-table database using MySQL Workbench.
* Be an Agile development team
* Use branching on Git/GitHub
* Understand Spring Application Contexts.
* Use the Java Persistence API to generate HTML.
* Build a Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.
* CSS and Bootstrap to make it web and mobile-friendly.

#### Agile Methodology is very effective:
Using Agile methodology, our team was able to stay organized and build an application we all are very proud of, in just one week.

#### Understand what minimum viable product is for this Sprint #1:
It's great to be ambitious, but it was even more important to keep in mind we only had one week to build the application. We are only completing Sprint 1 and had to understand, in the real world, there would be more Sprints in the future. We all worked out what core functionalities needed to be in place for a minimum viable product.

#### Write clean and readable code. Code is read more often than it's written!
Every member of the team worked on every part of the code base. As a result, it was essential for productivity, that everyone structure their code in a way that was easy to read and left comments often.

#### Invest a lot of time in app design and testing, during early stages of development:
The design process from the start of the development process is very important, as it serves as the foundation for the rest of the sprint. It was important for everyone on the team to have a shared vision of how we wanted the application to work from the outset. From there we worked very hard on getting the database schema and Java entities correct, and created JUNIT tests, before moving on to the next steps. This payed big dividends during the middle and later stages of the sprint.

#### Communication and Collaboration is key:
Every part of a dynamic web application has to work in sync. As a result, it was essential to communicate effectively with each other to keep continuity within the code base. We collaborated effectively with one another in meetings and in Pair Programming.
